# 🚀 Logiq AI Agent – Your AI-Powered Terminal Sidekick

> 🧠 Tired of googling terminal commands every 5 minutes?  
> 😵‍💫 Confused between `npm run dev`, `node index.js`, or `chmod +x`?  
> 🤖 Meet **Logiq AI Agent** – your personal command-line whisperer inside VS Code!

---

## 🎯 What Is It?

**Logiq AI Agent** is a smart VS Code extension that helps you run *any* terminal task using plain English.

Just tell it what you want (e.g., "Create a simple Node.js server"), and the agent will:
1. 🛠 Generate a step-by-step terminal command plan.
2. ✅ Ask for your approval.
3. 🧾 Run the commands in your terminal.
4. 🔁 If something goes wrong – it’ll ask for feedback, refine the plan, and try again.
5. 🔄 Keep asking for new tasks until you type `stop`.

> Think of it as **Copilot for the terminal** – but smarter, sassier, and always ready to help!
